## üìã Overview

This chapter covers the fundamental building blocks of C programming: variables, constants, and keywords. These concepts form the foundation for data storage and manipulation in any C program.

## üîç Key Concepts

- Variable declaration and initialization
- C data types (int, float, char, etc.)
- Rules for naming variables
- Memory allocation for different data types
- Constants and literals
- Type conversion and sizeof operator
- Standard input/output operations
- Comments and code documentation
- Escape sequences for formatting

## üíª Code Examples

| Filename | Description | Concepts Demonstrated |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| `01_Variables.c` | Basic variable usage | Variable declaration, initialization |
| `02_variables_rules.c` | Naming conventions | Valid/invalid identifiers, keywords |
| `03_data_types.c` | Different data types | int, float, char with proper formatting |
| `04_sizeof.c` | Memory requirements | sizeof operator, memory allocation |
| `05_comments.c` | Code documentation | Single-line and multi-line comments |
| `06_input.c` | User input | scanf function, input processing |
| `07_escape_sequence.c` | Formatting output | \n, \t, \b and other escape sequences |

## üìù Key Takeaways

- Variables are containers for storing data values that can change during program execution
- Each data type requires different amounts of memory and handles different types of values
- Following naming conventions is essential for writing clean, readable code
- C is a strongly typed language that requires explicit data type declarations
- Understanding memory allocation is fundamental to efficient C programming
- Input/output functions are essential for interactive programs
- Proper code documentation through comments enhances readability and maintenance
