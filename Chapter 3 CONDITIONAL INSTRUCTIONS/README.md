## üìã Overview

This chapter covers conditional statements in C, which allow programs to make decisions and execute different code paths based on conditions. These are fundamental building blocks for creating dynamic, responsive programs.

## üîç Key Concepts

- Basic if statements for simple conditions
- if-else statements for binary decisions
- else-if ladders for multiple conditions
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !) for complex conditions
- Switch statements for multi-way branching
- Conditional expressions using the ternary operator
- Non-zero values interpreted as true
- Nested conditional statements

## üíª Code Examples

| Filename | Description | Concepts Demonstrated |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| `01_conditionals.c` | Basic conditionals | Simple if statements |
| `02_if_else.c` | Two-way decisions | if-else structure, binary paths |
| `03_non_zero.c` | Truth values | How C evaluates conditions |
| `04_logical_operators.c` | Combining conditions | AND, OR, NOT operators |
| `05_else_if.c` | Multiple conditions | else-if ladders |
| `06_ternary.c` | Conditional expressions | Compact if-else alternative |
| `07_switch.c` | Multi-way branching | Switch-case structure |
| `08_quiz.c` | Applied conditionals | Interactive decision making |

## üìù Key Takeaways

- Conditional statements are essential for creating programs that can respond to different situations
- The if statement executes code only when a condition is true
- Logical operators allow building complex conditions
- The switch statement provides an efficient alternative to long else-if chains
- The ternary operator offers a compact way to write simple if-else statements
- Proper indentation and brackets help maintain readability in nested conditions
- Testing conditions thoroughly prevents unexpected behavior
