## üìã Overview

This chapter covers loop control structures in C, which enable programs to execute code blocks repeatedly. Loops are essential for tasks that require repetition, such as processing data sets or performing calculations iteratively.

## üîç Key Concepts

- While loops for condition-based iteration
- Do-while loops for at least one execution
- For loops for counter-based iteration
- Loop control with break statements
- Skip iterations with continue statements
- Nested loops for multi-dimensional operations
- Infinite loops and their applications
- Loop optimization techniques

## üíª Code Examples

| Filename | Description | Concepts Demonstrated |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| `01_while_loop.c` | Basic while loop | Condition-based iteration |
| `02_for_loop.c` | Counter-based loops | Initialization, condition, increment |
| `03_do_while.c` | Post-test loops | Execute-then-test pattern |
| `04_break.c` | Loop termination | Breaking out of loops conditionally |
| `05_continue.c` | Skip iterations | Bypassing specific iterations |
| `06_nested_loops.c` | Multi-level loops | Inner and outer loop relationships |
| `07_patterns.c` | Pattern generation | Loop-based visual pattern creation |
| `08_factorial.c` | Mathematical series | Loop-based calculations |

## üìù Key Takeaways

- Loops allow efficient implementation of repetitive tasks
- The choice between while, do-while, and for depends on specific requirements
- Breaking out of loops provides control over when iteration stops
- Continue statements allow skipping parts of loop bodies conditionally
- Nested loops are powerful for processing multi-dimensional data
- Loop efficiency is critical for performance in large-scale operations
- Proper loop control prevents infinite execution
- Loop counters and conditions must be carefully managed
