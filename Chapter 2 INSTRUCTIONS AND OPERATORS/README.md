## üìã Overview

This chapter explores C's instructions and operators, essential for manipulating data and performing calculations. Understanding these components is crucial for writing effective expressions and statements in C programs.

## üîç Key Concepts

- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)
- Increment and decrement operators (++, --)
- Relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
- Operator precedence and associativity
- Type conversion (implicit and explicit)
- Typecasting techniques

## üíª Code Examples

| Filename | Description | Concepts Demonstrated |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| `01_variables.c` | Variable operations | Assignment, initialization |
| `02_arithmetic_operators.c` | Basic calculations | Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division |
| `03_type_conversion.c` | Data type handling | Automatic type conversion, type compatibility |
| `04_associativity.c` | Operator behavior | Precedence rules, expression evaluation order |
| `05_typecasting.c` | Manual conversion | Explicit type conversion between data types |

## üìù Key Takeaways

- Arithmetic operators follow mathematical precedence rules in C
- Operator precedence determines the order of operations in complex expressions
- Associativity determines the order of evaluation when operators have equal precedence
- Implicit type conversion happens automatically when mixing data types
- Explicit type conversion (typecasting) gives the programmer control over data type changes
- Understanding operator behavior is essential for writing bug-free expressions
- Careful attention to data types is necessary to avoid unexpected results
