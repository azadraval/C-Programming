## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This practice set contains exercises designed to reinforce conditional logic and decision-making structures in C. These problems help develop the ability to implement various branching scenarios in programs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Practice Problems

| Problem | Filename | Description | Concepts Applied |
|---------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | `01_even_odd.c` | Number Classification | if-else, modulo operator |
| 2 | `02_eligibility.c` | Age Verification | Comparison operators, logical operators |
| 3 | `03_max_min.c` | Finding Extremes | Multiple conditions, nested if |
| 4 | `04_grading.c` | Grade Calculator | else-if ladder, ranges |
| 5 | `05_calculator.c` | Simple Calculator | switch statement, arithmetic |
| 6 | `06_input_validation.c` | Data Validation | Logical operators, error handling |
| 7 | `07_nested_decisions.c` | Complex Decisions | Nested if-else structures |

## ðŸ’¡ Skills Practiced

- Implementing binary decision structures with if-else
- Creating multi-way decisions with else-if ladders and switch
- Combining multiple conditions with logical operators
- Validating user input before processing
- Writing defensive code to handle edge cases
- Structuring nested conditional blocks for complex logic
- Using the ternary operator for compact conditional expressions

## ðŸ”‘ Solutions Approach

Each solution implements these practices:
- Clear condition expressions that prioritize readability
- Efficient branching logic that minimizes redundant checks
- Structured code with proper indentation for nested conditions
- Thorough handling of all possible cases
- User-friendly feedback for input validation
- Consistent formatting of output based on conditions
- Strategic use of switch vs. else-if based on the problem
